<p>What is HTML?
Let’s start by breaking down exactly what the acronym ‘HTML’ stands for. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is effectively a text within a text, and a markup language is a language understood by computers, designed to essentially describe webpages and make the text you use more interactive.

It was originally invented back in 1989 as the publishing language of the web, and to put it very simply, it is the first building block in creating a webpage. When you first come across the world of HTML, you’ll likely encounter a whole ream of terms and phrases that are somewhat baffling too. The three main ones are elements, tags, and attributes.</p>
